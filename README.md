# Plotly
## Introduction

In this challenge we are going to help Rosa to create a dashboard  which has a completed panel for demographic information and visualized the bacterial data for each volunteer. More specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Analysis
First created a horizontal bar chart using JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. The horizontal bar chart will display the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart.

Next we created a bubble chart  using JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js will display the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage:
The otu_ids as the x-axis values.
The sample_values as the y-axis values.
The sample_values as the marker size.
The otu_ids as the marker colors.
The otu_labels as the hover-text values.

Then we created a gauge chart using JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.

Next we customized dashboard using  HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
* Added an image to the jumbotron.
* Added background color or a variety of compatible colors to the webpage.
* Made the webpage mobile-responsive.
* Changed the layout of the page.
* Added a navigation bar that allows you to select the bar or bubble chart on the page.

 When the dashboard is first opened in a browser, ID 940’s data is displayed in the dashboard, and the three charts are working according to their requirements.When a sample is selected, the dashboard displays the data in the panel and all three charts according to their requirements.
